# Solana Exporter
## Overview

The Solana Exporter exports basic monitoring data from a Solana node, using the 
[Solana RPC API](https://solana.com/docs/rpc).

### Example Usage

To use the Solana Exporter, simply run the program with the desired 
[command line configuration](#Command-Line-Arguments), e.g.,

```shell
solana-exporter \
  -nodekey <VALIDATOR_IDENTITY_1> -nodekey <VALIDATOR_IDENTITY_2> \
  -balance-address <ADDRESS_1> -balance-address <ADDRESS_2> \
  -comprehensive-slot-tracking \
  -monitor-block-sizes
  -active-identity <MY_ACTIVE_IDENTITY>
```

### Features
#### Balance Tracking

Using the `-balance-address <ADDRESS>` configuration parameter, the exporter can be used to monitor any account's
SOL balance.

#### Block Sizes

If the `-monitor-block-sizes` flag is set, then the exporter will export the number of transactions (both vote and 
non-vote transactions) in blocks produced by the monitored validators. This is a critical validator performance metric. 

Cluster average block size can be inferred by dividing total network transactions by total block height.

#### Income Reporting

The exporter exports metrics regarding total priority fee revenue and inflation reward revenue earned by the 
monitored validators.

#### Skip Rate

The exporter does not directly export skip rate, as this needs to be defined as an average over a desired timeframe. 
However, the exporter does track the monitored validators leader slots and whether they are `valid` or `skipped`.

The example prometheus setup contains [recording rules](prometheus/solana-rules.yml) for measuring average skip rate 
for both individual validators and a cluster-level over hourly, daily and epoch intervals.

#### Active/Passive Monitoring

The `solana_node_is_active` metric simply reports whether the node (on which the exporter is running) has the same 
identity-keypair as that configured with the `-active-identity` flag. The `-active-identity` flag should be used to 
specify the primary identity when using a 
[non-delinquent backup validator](https://pumpkins-pool.gitbook.io/pumpkins-pool).

#### Light Mode

Certain metrics, such as validator leader slots, income, block size and active stake, are visible on-chain through any 
trusted node. However, other metrics such as node health and block height can only be viewed from an exporter running 
on the node in question. Thus, on a node in which fine margins of performance are of critical interest, the exporter 
can be set to `-light-mode`. In light mode, it will only export metrics that cannot be viewed from other nodes.

This is particularly useful in setups that contain an important validator and utility RPC node - the exporter can be 
run in light mode on the validator and in full capacity on the RPC node (configured to monitor the validator through 
use of the `-nodekey` parameter).

#### General Performance and Health

In addition to the above features, the exporter provides key metrics for monitoring Solana node health and performance. 
See [Metrics](#metrics) below for more details.

## Installation
### Build

Assuming you already have [Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install), the `solana-exporter` can be installed by 
cloning this repository and building the binary:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/asymmetric-research/solana-exporter.git
cd solana-exporter
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./cmd/solana-exporter
```

## Configuration
### Command Line Arguments

The exporter is configured via the following command line arguments:

### Notes on Configuration

* `-light-mode` is incompatible with `-nodekey`, `-balance-address`, `-monitor-block-sizes`, and 
`-comprehensive-slot-tracking`, as these options control metrics which are not monitored in `-light-mode`.
* ***WARNING***:
  * Configuring `-comprehensive-slot-tracking` will lead to potentially thousands of new Prometheus metrics being 
  created every epoch.
  * Configuring `-monitor-block-sizes` with many `-nodekey`'s can potentially strain the node - every block produced 
  by a configured `-nodekey` is fetched, and a typical block can be as large as 5MB.

#### Vote Account Metrics

The following metrics are all received from the `getVoteAccounts` [RPC endpoint](https://solana.com/docs/rpc/http/getvoteaccounts):
* `solana_validator_active_stake`
* `solana_validator_last_vote`
* `solana_validator_root_slot`
* `solana_validator_delinquent`

***NOTE***: If `-comprehensive-vote-account-tracking` is configured, then these metrics are tracked for **all** 
validators. Regardless of comprehensive tracking, the above metrics' cluster counterparts are always tracked for easy 
cluster-level comparison.

### Labels

The table below describes the various metric labels:

| Label              | Description                                   | Options / Example                                    |
