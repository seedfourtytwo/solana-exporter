#### Renamed Metrics

The table below contains all metrics renamed in `v3.0.0` (**[@johnstonematt](https://github.com/johnstonematt)**):

| Old Name                              | New Name                                       |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `solana_validator_activated_stake`    | `solana_validator_active_stake`                |
| `solana_confirmed_transactions_total` | `solana_node_transactions_total`               |
| `solana_confirmed_slot_height`        | `solana_node_slot_height`                      |
| `solana_confirmed_epoch_number`       | `solana_node_epoch_number`                     |
| `solana_confirmed_epoch_first_slot`   | `solana_node_epoch_first_slot`                 |
| `solana_confirmed_epoch_last_slot`    | `solana_node_epoch_last_slot`                  |
| `solana_leader_slots_total`           | `solana_validator_leader_slots_total`          |
| `solana_leader_slots_by_epoch`        | `solana_validator_leader_slots_by_epoch_total` |
| `solana_active_validators`            | `solana_cluster_validator_count`               |

Metrics were renamed to:
* Remove commitment levels from metric names.
* Standardise naming conventions:
  * `solana_validator_*`: Validator-specific metrics which are trackable from any RPC node (i.e., active stake).
  * `solana_node_*`: Node-specific metrics which are not trackable from other nodes (i.e., node health).

#### Label Updates

The following labels were renamed (**[@johnstonematt](https://github.com/johnstonematt)**):
 * `pubkey` was renamed to `votekey`, to clearly identity that it refers to the address of a validators vote account.

### Config Updates
#### New Config Parameters

Below is a list of newly added config parameters (see the [README](README.md) 
for parameter descriptions) (**[@johnstonematt](https://github.com/johnstonematt)**):

 * `-balance-address`
 * `-nodekey`
 * `-comprehensive-slot-tracking`
 * `-monitor-block-sizes`
 * `-slot-pace`
 * `-light-mode`
 * `-http-timeout`
 * `-comprehensive-vote-account-tracking`
 * `-active-identity`
 * `epoch-cleanup-time`

#### Renamed Config Parameters

The table below contains all config parameters renamed in `v3.0.0` (**[@johnstonematt](https://github.com/johnstonematt)**):

| Old Name                            | New Name          |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `-rpcURI`                           | `-rpc-url`        |
| `addr`                              | `-listen-address` |

#### Removed Config Parameters

The following metrics were removed (**[@johnstonematt](https://github.com/johnstonematt)**):

 * `votepubkey`. Configure validator tracking using the `-nodekey` parameter.

### General Updates

* The project was renamed from `solana_exporter` to `solana-exporter`, to conform with 
[Go naming conventions](https://github.com/unknwon/go-code-convention/blob/main/en-US.md) (**[@johnstonematt](https://github.com/johnstonematt)**).
* Testing was significantly improved (**[@johnstonematt](https://github.com/johnstonematt)**).
* [klog](https://github.com/kubernetes/klog) logging was removed and replaced with [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap)
  (**[@johnstonematt](https://github.com/johnstonematt)**)
* Easy usage (**[@johnstonematt](https://github.com/johnstonematt)**):
  * The example dashboard was updated.
  * An example prometheus config was added, as well as recording rules for tracking skip rate.

# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

* Added `solana_validator_commission` metric to track validator commission percentage rates (0-100)
* Added metric collections for credits earned per Epoch and lifetime
* Enhanced balance tracking to automatically include validator identity and vote account addresses


### Changed

* Improved light mode to completely eliminate cluster metrics and reduce validator load
* Light mode now only exports node-specific metrics and validator credits (when identity is provided)
* Removed metric overlap between light mode and regular mode
* Enhanced balance tracking to provide more detailed logging and validation

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security
